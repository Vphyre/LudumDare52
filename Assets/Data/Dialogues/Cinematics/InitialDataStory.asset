  listStoryTexts:
  - Kon is a free-spirited adventurer, who used to travel the world and had been
    riding a motorcycle on the roads in the interior of Brazil for a year.
  - It was Friday the thirteenth in the afternoon when his vehicle's tire went flat
    and he was forced to stop on the side of the road.
  - As it gets dark and with no place to spend the night, he visualizes a dirt road
    that takes him to a small besieging village.
  - 'He tries to seek help from the residents, but does not see anyone, so he decides
    to approach the door of one of the farthest houses and realizes that it is ajar,
    seeing lights calls again, and once again there is no answer. '
  - The brave man enters the small house still afraid and goes towards the only illuminated
    room.
  - To his surprise, he ends up finding a cat figurine on top of a table next to
    a candle.
  - curious, he takes the object...
  - ' then begins to feel an intense headache until falling unconscious on the floor. '
  - Upon receiving the first rays of sunlight of the day, the young man gradually
    regains his consciousness and realizes that something different has happened,
    his arms were covered in dark and silky hair, his feet and hands were now in
    the shape of paws, his ears were sensitive and pointed at the same time that
    he noticed his wet nose, his scream echoed throughout the place when he discovered
    that he now also had a thick and fluffy cat's tail. In desperation, he finds
    an abandoned and broken piece of mirror in the corner of that room and to his
    sadness and agony he confirms his suspicions, now he was a large and half humanoid
    feline figure with an intense yellow look
  - 'Kon, panting and desperate, ran out the door he entered, with his thoughts too
    messed up to realize that the place was now all transformed, it no longer looked
    like an abandoned property, he could seelands prepared for planting and the place
    that seemed abandoned was now all organized. The adventurer could not believe
    what he was seeing, walking towards him came an elderly looking kitten that was
    not alone, around him there was a kind of fish that curiously seemed to be swimming
    in the air, with a calm smile on his slightly wrinkled face. the ancient feline
    says:'
  - "-\tFinally, we've been waiting for years for you to join us. Welcome! I'm Nyantonio
    - the strange cat points to the floating being beside him - and this one is the
    number one helper of the Mother of Water, Dourado -, I've been taking care of
    this village for centuries. "
  - "-\tWhere am I? What am I? - said Kon, still visibly stunned- what am I doing
    here?"
  - "-\tI'll explain everything to you, you..."
  - A loud bang happens near the plantation and everyone panics. When they suddenly
    saw the cause of all the confusion, it was a creature that he had only seen in
    the books of his childhood. He had flaming hair, a pointed spear in one hand,
    his feet were turned backwards, his clothes were tribal, his eyes were red. like
    blood they glowed intensely and their strong hissing made large and strong eddies
    of wind.
  - "-\tIt's Curupira-nyan! This way, hurry, we don't have time - the old cat's countenance
    totally changed and his first reaction was to pull Kon to a safe place - here
    we can talk a little, listen well, time is short, we've been caught by the black
    cat's curse, we have to defeat the guardians to break it and we can go back to
    being human, we were hopeless when Iara-nyan prophesied that one day, on a friday
    the thirteenth with a full moon, the hero would come. Our land is magic, our
    plantation will help you, Dourado, show him! Grab corn and aim for the red-haired
    guardian quickly!"
  - "-\tBut\u2026but\u2026 - Kon was looking perplexed while the small fish aimed
    and launched something towards the cause of all that fuss, popcorn started hitting
    the rival and he retreated until he ran away."
  - After the scare, the black-furred feline looks at the old man with an astonished
    face, Nyantonio smiles awkwardly and starts looking in his bag for something;
  - "-\tYou have to be here, just a minute..."
  - With an expression of satisfaction, he then reveals a small bag to Kon and hands
    it to the hero's paws;
  - "-\tMy young man, these are magic seeds to help you in this mission - the old
    man then starts showing one by one - This is the one fromimprover, as you can
    see, it's a fast weapon that shreds popcorn, but it grows every day;is here is
    the potatobom, You can tell by the name what it does, right?"
  - "-\tIt will Grow every twelve hours, just throw it and\u2026boom! Ah, this one
    is my favorite, Cenorai -(laughs)- which grows every hour and always in large
    numbers, we can always have a hand when the guardians appear, and finally this
    is the banana orange which grows quickly and you will never be disarmed if you
    have it, but its damage is very small. But since not everything is perfect, unfortunately
    our weapons rot very quickly, so we always have to plant them, good luck\u2026"
  - "-\tOh holy cat! I'm lost! - exclaims Kon with great concern."
  - 'With the bag in its paws, the young cat heads towards the plantation area -Since
    there''s no other way, I''m going for it! '
