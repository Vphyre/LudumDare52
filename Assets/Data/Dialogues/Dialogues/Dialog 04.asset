  - Hello there... By the way who are you two?
  - What? What are you saying old man? Don't tell me you're forgetting things now?
    I'm Kon! And that's the fish... It's the Dourado!
  - Kon? ... Oh I... I mean, this is just a joke with you guys. HAHA.
  - What a fright, Mr. Nyantonio! I thought the terrible fate of the Baobab tree
    had fallen on you!
  - Things are really strange... nowadays a potato takes 4 days to be ready for harvest...
    Before the curse of the legends fell on these lands, you could harvest potatoes
    with 1 day...
  - This curse of legends gives me the shivers... I just want to be human again!
